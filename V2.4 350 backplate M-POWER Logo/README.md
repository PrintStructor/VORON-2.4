I've printed this as a multicolor print with SuperSlicer with 1 extruder set to 5 extruders with manual filament changes. 

HowTo:
1. add the file 1_hexagon to your build plate.
2. join everthing else by right clicking 1_hexagon on the right menu and choose -> add part -> load | from the menu.
3. set your files by right clikcing on them to your created extruders. I've named the files like the colors I used for a better overview.
